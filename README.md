Minetest Converter Mod
==========

Crafting large quantities of some decorative blocks can require a lot of clicking.
You might have to craft two stone to two decorative stone #1 and then craft one decorative stone #1 to one decorative stone #2 and so on.
And finally, one decorative stone #10 can be crafted back to one stone.

This mod allows conversion recipes to be defined for such items and may optionally be set as bi-directional.
The converter holds 8 stacks of items and a single result item.
A single button click will convert an entire stack.
A single unit of the result item must be crafted manually but then it is used as a template to craft more.
